** DONE Fix LVM Snapshots
SCHEDULED: <2011-07-18 Mon> CLOSED: [2011-07-18 Mon 22:29]

  Clearly, we need to Fix up ebs-create
- Note taken on [2011-07-18 Mon 15:32] \\
  /usr/local/twilio/src/php/scripts/ec2/run-command.php needs to check
  whether its getting an EC2 failure. Otherwise we silently fail on
  ebs-create, which causes create-backup-ebs-partition to fail. Sad news
- Note taken on [2011-07-18 Mon 14:14] \\
  Things to note:
  conf is stored in /etc/lvm/lvm.conf
  We first make a backup with:

  mkdir -p /backup/

  Then we run /usr/local/sbin/create-backup-ebs-partition
  Make sure to check /etc/fstab for /dev/sdz entry(/dev/sdz is the hardcoded value for the backup volume)y

  We then run /usr/local/sbin/mysql-backup

  /usr/bin/docbook2x* and /etc/init.d/mysqld need to die(or be ln -sf
  or something)
  cepstral has two different versions for swift. Something to consider
  reviewing
  ec2 is totally crazy- there are full scripts being made with here
  documents. We should really consider making these independent files
  in source control. The current system confusing and unintuitive.
