* Introduced bugs after testing initially, due to changing code
** Need to implement TDD
*** Suggest having emacs way to run tests which are named according to some convention
*** Suggest having it possible to be set as an after-save hook
** Changing base operators, such as *, caused bugs which were hard to detect and reason about
*** Avoid changing __add__, __mul__, etc in the future 
*** Instead, implement addPair, mulPair, etc. Easier to think about/keep seperate
* Architecture was insufficient
** Start with solved problem, make sure you return correct state. Then, reason about a problem 1 step away, etc.
** Use Hilfinger style "code complete solution, assuming these magic functions exist"
