Orestes and his sister, Electra, arrive at Agamemnon's grave to find that their mother, Clytemnestra, has sent libation bearers to the grave. The two conspire to seek revenge, and conjure up the spirit of their father to aid them in their plot; Orestes and his companion Pylades will pretend to be travelers from Phocis, and thus gain entry to the house. Orestes kills his father’s usuper,  Aegisthus, and then confronts Clytemnestra, and must choose between fulfilling his familial duty to his father or his mother. Pylades convincing him to fulfill his duty to Apollo, he kills his mother, and as a result the Furies begin to haunt him as the chorus suggests that the cycle of violence will continue.
